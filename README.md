# Placement_Portal
Linking companies and students
This project was developed solely with students and companies during placement time in mind. With the current method companies send the notifications about available postings or selected candidates or related stuff thorugh college who in turn announce these in whatsapp groups. Since some people tend to miss these or may not have joined the group and missed the oppurtunity because of that, I tried to do this project. Here, the companies can directly add postings to which students can apply and the companies can see the applicants and reply to them. Planning to add more features such as notifiying students before scheduled interviews and also if they are selected for the second round and so on. Planning on adding admin module who will be able to verify the details during signup. Also planning on getting resume of students during signup itself and not asking them to upload a resume everytime they apply.
