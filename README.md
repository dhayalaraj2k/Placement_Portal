# Placement_Portal
Linking companies and students  
This project aims to link students and companies during placement time. With the current method companies send the notifications about available postings or selected candidates or related stuff thorugh college who in turn announce these in whatsapp groups. Since some people tend to miss these or may not have joined the group and missed the oppurtunity because of that, I tried to do this project. Here, the companies can directly add postings to which students can apply and the companies can see the applicants and reply to them. Planning to add more features such as notifiying students before scheduled interviews and also if they are selected for the second round and so on. Planning on adding admin module who will be able to verify the details during signup and getting resume of students during signup itself so as to avoid asking them to upload the resume everytime they apply.
